# Mech105-Projects

This repository contains projects from the Mech 105 Numerical Methods course from Spring 2018 Semester at CSU. Each Project contains a MatLab algorithm which can be implemented to solve a certain numerical methods including differentiation and integration. A brief description of each algorthm is given below with a more in-depth explanation within each individual folder.

### falsePosition

The False Postion algorithm is used to estimate the root of a given function.

### luFactor

The lu Factor algorithm performs LU factorization on a given matrix.

### Simpson

The Simpson algorithm performs numerical integration using the Simpon's 1/3 Rule on a given x vector and y vector of values.
